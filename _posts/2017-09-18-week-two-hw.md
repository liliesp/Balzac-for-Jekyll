For my first web map, I made a map that tells a little bit about where my mom grew up in Poland and a story about my family. 
I started thinking about how I'm unfamiliar with the geography of my family history, which spans all over the place, and wanted to make something that would help me contextualize and understand that history as well as give others an understanding of it.

### Single Image Figure

{% highlight html linenos %}
<figure>
	<img src="/images/image-filename-1.jpg">
	<figcaption>Caption describing these two images.</figcaption>
</figure>
{% endhighlight %}
